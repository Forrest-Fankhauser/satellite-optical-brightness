The primary surfaces of the Starlink v1.5 configurations
are the chassis underside (nadir) and the solar array.
During the brightness regime of concern, the chassis normal
points directly to geodetic nadir.
This normal vector is N = (0, 0, -1) in the satellite-centered frame*.
The solar array is perpendicular to the chassis and towards
the sun.
The normal vector is N = (0, 1, 0) in the satellite-centered frame*.

The area of the solar array is 22.68 m^2.
The area of the chassis nadir is 3.64 m^2.
